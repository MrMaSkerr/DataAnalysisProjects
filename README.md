# DataAnalyticsProjects

This repo is created as portfolio to show main data analysis skills.
There will be 3 parts of it:
1. Skills folder, where I published what I consider to be the main statistical methods. (There may be released ANOVA notebook in future, but I shipped it for now)
2. Folders with real-life data analysis, to show pandas, numpy and matplotlib and data processing skills. (Coming soon)
3. Link to the tableau dashboards visualizing relults got from item 2.
