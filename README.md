# DataAnalyticsProjects

This repository is created as a portfolio to show my data analysis skills.
There will be 3 parts of it:
1. Skills folder, where I published what I consider to be the main and most important statistical methods. (There may be released ANOVA notebook in future, but I skipped it for now)
2. Folders with real-life data analysis, to show pandas, numpy and matplotlib and data processing skills. (Coming soon)
3. Link to the tableau dashboards that visualize results got from item 2.

By now, the Skills folder is ready (except for the ANOVA notebook) and I'm working on item 2 of the list above
